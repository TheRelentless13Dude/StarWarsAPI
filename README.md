# Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### To build the Project:

In order to build the project, you need to run Maven Clean, followed by Maven Install.

These are located underneath the StarWarsAPI > Lifecycle directory.

Running these commands will install all dependencies within the pom.xml file required for this project to run.

### Current status:

This is a new approach I tried taking. I am unfortunately just as confused as before, and require more knowledge and
experience within both Java 17(Knowledge base is limited to 6 and 8, with a bit of 11.) 

### Current Issues:

I am unable to check if this documented list of people is being created correctly.
From the logs, I am able to out-print the result set. I do not know if this is being created as yet.
I cannot seem to understand the connection between various different beans and their linkages. 
More studying and a hands-on experience required.

Please note, this branch is mainly for personal development and growth.
